# ysoserial 

A proof-of-concept tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization.

## Description

Released as part of AppSecCali 2015 Talk ["Marshalling Pickles: how deserializing objects will ruin your day"](http://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/) 

__ysoserial__ is a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming "gadget chains" discovered in common java 
libraries that can, under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing __unsafe deserialization__ of objects. 
The main driver program takes a user-specified command and wraps it in the user-specified gadget chain, then
serializes these objects to stdout. When an application with the required gadgets on the classpath unsafely deserializes
this data, the chain will automatically be invoked and cause the command to be executed on the application host.

It should be noted that the vulnerability lies in the application performing unsafe deserialization and NOT in having
gadgets on the classpath.

This version edited by Federico Dotta add the possibility to generate a gadget that lead to the java.lang.Thread.sleep function in addction
to the java.lang.Runtime.exec one. The sleep function can be easly used to verify the presence of the vulnerability, before using the 
exec payload to exploit it. It is usefull to have an easy way to detect the presence of the issue because the exec command don't return any output
and in some cirumstances can be very hard to understand if the injected command has been executed.
